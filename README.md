## 🔍 Overview

Urban traffic congestion leads to increased travel time, pollution, and fuel consumption. This **Traffic Route Optimizer** leverages real-time data from sensors/cameras and historical traffic patterns to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings, predict congestion, and optimize vehicle flow across intersections.

Built during **Smart India Hackathon**, this solution aims to make city transportation smarter, safer, and more efficient using modern technologies such as **machine learning**, **IoT**, and **real-time web interfaces**.

## ✨ Features

✅ **Dynamic Signal Control**  
   - Adjusts traffic light durations based on real-time vehicle density at each lane.

✅ **Congestion Detection**  
   - Uses computer vision (or simulated data) to detect traffic buildup and trigger alerts.

✅ **Traffic Flow Prediction**  
   - Predicts peak hours and congestion using ML models (e.g., LSTM, Random Forest).

✅ **Web Dashboard**  
   - Real-time monitoring of all intersections via an intuitive admin dashboard.

✅ **Emergency Vehicle Priority**  
   - Grants green light priority to ambulances/fire engines via RFID/GPS detection.

✅ **Data Analytics & Reporting**  
   - Visualize daily traffic trends, bottlenecks, and system performance.

✅ **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  - The system is uniquely designed to run efficiently on both Raspberry Pi and smartphones, enabling low-cost, scalable deployment.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Input**: Live video feed from CCTV cameras or sensor data (simulated).
2. **Processing**: Detect vehicles using OpenCV/YOLO and calculate lane-wise density.
3. **Decision Engine**: Use ML model to predict optimal signal timing.
4. **Output**: Send updated signal durations to traffic lights.
5. **Monitoring**: Admin dashboard displays live stats and allows manual override.
